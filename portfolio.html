            <p> <!-- This is a paragraph, it's the main way to display text on a web page -->
                By the end of the lecture and seminar, I learned how to use GitHub, Visual Studio Code, and embed live charts into my website.
                I also learned how to organise the page into sections, with each section containing a chart, title and a description. Here, I can describe the chart and give some context.
                As a first example, I am using a basic chart from the existing repository.
            </p>
        </div>
        <h3 class="small">
            <strong> Chart 1: GDP and Life Expectancy </strong> 
        </h3>
        <p> Here, I embeded the chart which visualises the relationship between GDP per capita and life expectancy. I took this chart from <a href="https://www.economicsobservatory.com/explore">Economics Observatory</a> without any adjustments.</p>

            <h2>Week 2: Playing with Vega-Lite Editor</h2>
            <p> <!-- This is a paragraph, it's the main way to display text on a web page -->
                Last week, I  learned how to copy and paste the chart from template to this website. This week, I learned how to customize charts using the <a href="vega.github.io/editor/">Vega Lite Editor</a>. Simple steps: I pick dataset from <a href="https://www.economicsobservatory.com/create">Economics Observatory</a>, then I copy-paste-customize the code in <a href="vega.github.io/editor/">Vega Lite Editor</a>. Since I am from Indonesia, I chose the data from this country. I will start with the basics: GDP growth. I customized the chart so that the colors and fonts match with the setting in my website.
            </p>
        </div>
        <h3 class="small">
            <strong>Chart 4: Indonesia GDP Growth</strong> 
        </h3>
        <p>I added a dashed line at the y-axis with a value of 0 to indicate that there was a contraction during the 2020-2021 period due to Covid-19. I managed to create a shading for the contraction period, accompanied by a note stating "Covid-19" in the <a href="vega.github.io/editor/">Vega Lite Editor</a>. However, when I embedded the chart on my website, it did not appear. I will take note of this issue and provide you with an update later.</p>

        <figure id="Location4"></figure> 
        <p><strong>Update:</strong> I managed to attach the Covid-19 shaded chart in this page after resolving problems in the chart's json file. We can find the list of the problems by shortcut Ctrl+Shift+M in our visual Studio Code.</p>

        <h3 class="small">
            <strong>Chart 5: Indonesia Inflation</strong> 
        </h3>
        <p> I retrieved Indonesia's inflation data from the <a href="https://www.economicsobservatory.com/create">Economics Observatory</a>, which sources its API data from the Statistics Office of Indonesia. However, it was not immediately clear whether the data represented monthly or annual percentages. So, I took the following steps: (1) Check the data. After checking the data, I found that it reflects the month-on-month percentage change (MoM) so I edited the notes below the title. (2) Due to the  fluctuation caused by seasonality, I chose to show only the end-of-period (December) data. Additionally, I limited the data to start from 2011 to align it with the GDP data above.</p>

        <figure id="Location5"></figure>
        <br>
        <p> However, the data above is not up-to-date (the latest data is from 2019). Therefore, I created another csv dataset and uploaded it in GitHub, then built the chart from scratch. I also added a tooltip so we can hover over the line chart to display the month and value. 
            <br>
            <figure id="Location6"></figure>            
            Interestingly, the current dataset reveals that Indonesia experienced deflation for five consecutive months. This is a rare occurence, even during Covid-19 pandemic. Some attribute it to declining purchasing power. But is that really the case?</p>
